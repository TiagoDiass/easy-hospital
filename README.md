  :rocket: Used Technologies
</h2>

#### Front-end techs:
- [Vue.js](https://br.vuejs.org) to build all the front-end in general
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) to manage the state of the application
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to create all the styles of the application
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com.br/) to have some basic styles in some components
- [Sweet Alert](https://sweetalert.js.org/) to give the user friendlier alerts
- [Axios.js](https://github.com/axios/axios) to make the requests for the backend

#### Back-end([repository here](https://github.com/TiagoDiass/easy-hospital-backend)) techs:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) To build the REST API in general
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) Framework for building REST APIs with Node.js
- [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/) to interact with the database
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database


<h2 id="objective" name="objective">
  :dart: The project's goal
</h2>

The aim of this project was practicing Vue, Vuex and Node, it was a kind of challenge that I made for myself to check if I could build some project like this one completely by myself. I enjoyed really much developing this WebApp and I loved the final result. With this project I've learned a lot about organization and structure in Vue.js apps, it was really good! By the way, the backend repository is [here](https://github.com/TiagoDiass/easy-hospital-backend)
